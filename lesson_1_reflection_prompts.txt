How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Bug was introduced after the change, hence it limted the search. And output of diff helped manually inspecting the code. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see through the changes and learn which was the best

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: commits are logical.
    Con: user may forget to make changes often enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because those files are related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history of all commits, git diff shows the changes made between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that i can always revert back so i would experiment a lot

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
